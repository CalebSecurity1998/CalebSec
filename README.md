# CalebSec Security Operations Platform

CalebSec is a modular SOC-style cybersecurity platform built with **FastAPI**, **SQLite**, and a modern web dashboard. It is designed to simulate real security operations workflows including SIEM monitoring, alert triage, IOC enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, phishing analysis, case tracking, audit logging, and analyst investigation notes.

---

## Project Purpose

This project was built as a hands-on cybersecurity portfolio project to demonstrate practical blue-team and SOC analyst skills. CalebSec simulates how security teams collect logs, review alerts, investigate suspicious activity, enrich indicators of compromise, and document findings.

---

## Key Features

- SIEM-style dashboard
- Security log ingestion
- Alert monitoring
- SOC alert triage workflow
- Threat intelligence / IOC lookup
- Local IOC risk scoring
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Case management
- Analyst notes
- Audit trail
- Phishing detection capability
- Suspicious activity simulation
- Hosted demo mode
- FastAPI backend
- SQLite database
- Render deployment support

# SOC Modules

## Dashboard

The main dashboard provides a high-level overview of current alerts, logs, open cases, and security activity.

---

## SOC Alert Triage

The SOC triage module allows analysts to review simulated security alerts, assign statuses, add notes, and track investigation decisions.

### Supported statuses

- New
- Investigating
- Escalated
- Resolved
- False Positive

---

## Threat Intelligence

The threat intelligence module supports IOC lookups for:

- IP addresses
- Domains
- URLs
- Hashes
- Suspicious command strings

Each lookup produces:

- Risk score
- Verdict
- MITRE mapping
- Summary of suspicious indicators

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Alerts and suspicious behaviors are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as:

- T1110 – Brute Force
- T1059.001 – PowerShell
- T1071 – Application Layer Protocol
- T1566 – Phishing
- T1204 – User Execution

---

# Example Use Cases

- Investigating brute-force login activity
- Reviewing suspicious PowerShell behavior
- Identifying potential malware beaconing
- Analyzing phishing indicators
- Enriching suspicious IPs and domains
- Tracking analyst investigation notes
- Simulating SOC alert response workflows

---

# Technology Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- Jinja2 Templates
- HTML/CSS
- Render
- GitHub
