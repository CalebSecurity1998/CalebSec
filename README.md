# CalebSec Security Operations Platform

CalebSec is a modular SOC-style cybersecurity platform built with **FastAPI**, **SQLite**, and a modern web dashboard. It is designed to simulate real security operations workflows including SIEM monitoring, alert triage, IOC enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, phishing analysis, case tracking, audit logging, and analyst investigation notes.

# SOC Modules

## Dashboard

The main dashboard provides a high-level overview of current alerts, logs, open cases, and security activity.

---

## SOC Alert Triage

The SOC triage module allows analysts to review simulated security alerts, assign statuses, add notes, and track investigation decisions.

### Supported statuses

- New
- Investigating
- Escalated
- Resolved
- False Positive

---

## Threat Intelligence

The threat intelligence module supports IOC lookups for:

- IP addresses
- Domains
- URLs
- Hashes
- Suspicious command strings

Each lookup produces:

- Risk score
- Verdict
- MITRE mapping
- Summary of suspicious indicators

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Alerts and suspicious behaviors are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as:

- T1110 – Brute Force
- T1059.001 – PowerShell
- T1071 – Application Layer Protocol
- T1566 – Phishing
- T1204 – User Execution

---

# Example Use Cases

- Investigating brute-force login activity
- Reviewing suspicious PowerShell behavior
- Identifying potential malware beaconing
- Analyzing phishing indicators
- Enriching suspicious IPs and domains
- Tracking analyst investigation notes
- Simulating SOC alert response workflows

---

# Technology Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- Jinja2 Templates
- HTML/CSS

---

## RBAC / Authentication Add-On

CalebSec includes a role-based access control and authentication layer to simulate how real SOC platforms restrict access based on analyst responsibilities.

### Purpose

The RBAC and authentication module provides controlled access to CalebSec features by assigning users specific roles and permissions. This helps demonstrate secure application design, least-privilege access, and analyst workflow separation.

### Capabilities

* User authentication with username and password login
* Secure password hashing
* Bearer token-based API authentication
* Role-based route protection
* SQLite-backed user storage
* Default user roles for SOC workflows

### Supported Roles

| Role      | Purpose                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`   | Full platform access, user management, rule reloads, log ingestion, alerts, and events             |
| `analyst` | Operational SOC access for ingesting logs, reviewing alerts, reviewing events, and reloading rules |
| `viewer`  | Read-only access to events, alerts, and detection rules                                            |

### Example Permissions

| Permission   | Admin | Analyst | Viewer |
| ------------ | :---: | :-----: | :----: |
| Read users   |  Yes  |    No   |   No   |
| Create users |  Yes  |    No   |   No   |
| Ingest logs  |  Yes  |   Yes   |   No   |
| Read events  |  Yes  |   Yes   |   Yes  |
| Read alerts  |  Yes  |   Yes   |   Yes  |
| Read rules   |  Yes  |   Yes   |   Yes  |
| Reload rules |  Yes  |   Yes   |   No   |

### Default Local Development Account

When the database is initialized, a default local admin account is created:

| Username | Password       | Role    |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| `admin`  | `ChangeMe123!` | `admin` |

> This account is intended for local development only and should be changed before any public or production-style deployment.

---

## Live Log Ingestion Add-On

The live log ingestion module allows CalebSec to receive and process security events in real time.

### Purpose

This module simulates how a SIEM or SOC platform collects telemetry from systems, applications, and security tools. Incoming logs are normalized into CalebSec events and evaluated against loaded detection rules.

### Capabilities

* REST API log ingestion through `POST /ingest`
* Optional live file tailing for local log simulation
* JSON-line log parsing
* Plain-text fallback parsing
* Real-time alert generation when logs match Sigma-style rules
* In-memory event and alert queues for fast local prototyping

### Example JSON Log Event

```json
{
  "source": "windows",
  "event_id": 4625,
  "message": "Failed password for admin from 10.0.0.8",
  "user": "admin",
  "src_ip": "10.0.0.8"
}
```

### Example Plain-Text Log Event

```text
Failed password for root from 10.0.0.6
```

### Live File Tailing Example

```bash
python -m calebsec.main --serve --tail sample_logs/auth.log
```

Then append a test event:

```bash
echo '{"source":"linux-auth","message":"Failed password for root from 10.0.0.5","user":"root","src_ip":"10.0.0.5"}' >> sample_logs/auth.log
```

## Sigma Rule Support Add-On

CalebSec includes lightweight Sigma-style detection rule support to demonstrate detection engineering concepts.

### Purpose

Sigma is a common open rule format used to describe detection logic across security platforms. This add-on allows CalebSec to load YAML-based Sigma-style rules and match incoming events against those detections.

### Capabilities

* Loads `.yml` and `.yaml` rules from the `rules/` directory
* Matches incoming log events against detection logic
* Generates alerts when rules match
* Supports common starter Sigma detection patterns
* Allows rules to be reloaded without restarting the server

### Supported Detection Logic

The current lightweight matcher supports:

* `selection` maps
* Field equality
* Field lists
* `field|contains`
* Keyword lists
* `condition: selection`
* `condition: selection1 or selection2`
* `condition: selection1 and selection2`

> This is a lightweight Sigma-compatible matcher for portfolio and learning use. It is not a full Sigma backend or compiler implementation.

### Example Sigma-Style Rule

```yaml
id: failed-login-root
title: Failed Login for Root
level: high
detection:
  selection:
    message|contains: "Failed password"
    user: "root"
  condition: selection
```

### Example Multi-Selection Rule

```yaml
id: suspicious-admin-login-failure
title: Suspicious Admin Login Failure
level: medium
detection:
  selection1:
    message|contains: "Failed password"
  selection2:
    user:
      - "admin"
      - "administrator"
  condition: selection1 and selection2
```

### Rule Reload Example

After adding or editing rules, reload them with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/rules/reload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

## Add-On API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Purpose                                 |
| ------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/auth/login`   | Authenticate and receive a bearer token |
| `GET`  | `/users`        | List users                              |
| `POST` | `/users`        | Create a new user                       |
| `POST` | `/ingest`       | Ingest a log event                      |
| `GET`  | `/events`       | View recent ingested events             |
| `GET`  | `/alerts`       | View generated alerts                   |
| `GET`  | `/rules`        | List loaded detection rules             |
| `POST` | `/rules/reload` | Reload Sigma-style rules from disk      |

---

## Running the Add-On Locally

Install dependencies and initialize the database:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m calebsec.main --init-db
```

Start the API server:

```bash
python -m calebsec.main --serve
```

Start the API server with live file ingestion:

```bash
python -m calebsec.main --serve --tail sample_logs/auth.log
```

Run the local detection demo without starting the API:

```bash
python run_demo.py
```

---

## Security Notes

This add-on is designed for local development, portfolio demonstration, and SOC workflow simulation. Before using it in a production-style deployment:

* Change the default admin password
* Set a strong `CALEBSEC_SECRET`
* Put the API behind TLS
* Add login rate limiting
* Add account lockout controls
* Persist events and alerts to a database
* Add audit logging for login, rule reloads, and user management
* Expand Sigma support if full Sigma compatibility is required

---

## Current Add-On Limitations

* Events and alerts are stored in memory and reset when the process restarts
* SQLite user storage is intended for local and development use
* Bearer tokens are stateless and cannot currently be revoked before expiration
* Sigma support covers common starter detections, not the full Sigma specification
* File tailing reads newly appended lines only and does not backfill older file contents at startup
